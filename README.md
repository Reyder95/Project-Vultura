# Project Vultura

Project Vultura is a video game set in space, bringing great aspects of many games together to create a unique experience.

## Some Inspirations
* Terraria
* Stellaris
* Starsector
* Distant Worlds 2

## Phases

Project Vultura will undergo multiple phases of development. This is to organize the workflow and our focuses for each phase to keep things coherent.

### Phase 1 - Preparation [COMPLETE]
The preparation phase will contain all the grunt work to set up the game for further development. These will primarily focus on the initial preparations of the project. Such as Github (Hi!), project management (Asana), and so forth. It will be where we develop the basics of the game, primarily the galaxy generation, and other basic functions.

### Phase 2 - Gameplay Systems [CURRENT]
After the initial scenes and preparations have been completed, we can move onto actual gameplay. This will be where we develop all the gameplay systems, as well as clean up anything we may have missed in the last phase. Some systems include
* Colonies
* Ship movement
* Ship combat
* Building your empire

These and more will be developed in this phase of development. This will most likely be the longest phase of development, if not tied for phase 4

### Phase 3 - Advanced Gameplay
After most of the gameplay systems are done, we'd like to focus on a few key sections after the fact.
* Enemies in the world
* Exploration
* Boss fighting
* Itemization

These are some elements of a game that just NEED to be gotten right, and we'll focus on these for one entire phase to make sure things are smooth sailing

### Phase 4 - Creativity and Polishing
This phase will be when most of the core gameplay components are done. We will be focusing on polishing gameplay elements, making sure things play right and feel right. This is when sprites will be developed and created, and the art style of the game is realized. The game will look and feel better after this phase

### Phase 5 - Bug Fixing
The game will be extensively tested from the ground up once everything is completed. Fixing bugs rigorously to ensure the game feels fluid to play. 

### Release
Then we will release the game!
